Source_Code ->

'''Program : Guess the Number'''
num = 15
print("You have 8 attempts so let's guess the Correct Number !")
attempts = 8
for i in range(attempts):
    no_of_attmepts_left = attempts
    print("No. of attempts left ->", attempts)
    i = int(input("Guess the Number : "))
    if i == num:
        print("Congrats! You Guess the Correct Number, in ",(9-attempts), "attempt")
        break
    elif i < num:
        print(i, "is lesser than the Correct no. Try Again!")
    else :
        print(i, "is greater than the Correct no. Try Again!")
    if no_of_attmepts_left == 1:
        print("No more attempts left! if you want to try again then rerun the Program :)")
    attempts = attempts - 1
